Alchemix V3 maintains a transparent and predictable cost structure. All fees are set by on-chain governance and are categorized into three areas: redemption-based fees for borrowers and transmuters, an early-exit fee for queued assets, and a performance fee on yield generation.

## Borrower Redemption Fee

When the Transmuter converts queued alAssets into vault value, it credits that amount against outstanding loans. At that moment, a small fraction of the repaid debt is routed to the protocol treasury.

- **Current Rate:** 0.50%
- **Effective Cost:** Because this is event-based rather than time-based, the cost depends on your starting LTV and the duration of the transmutation.

Effective APR ≈ Fee × (1 year ÷ Transmutation Time) × Starting LTV

## Transmuter Fees

The Transmuter involves two distinct fee types depending on the user's action:

1. **Redemption Fee:** An optional fee applied when a Transmuter depositor claims their underlying assets.
   - **Current Rate:** 0.00%
2. **Early Transmutation Fee:** A fee applied when a user chooses to withdraw their funds from the Transmuter queue before the transmutation process is complete. This ensures the system remains stable and penalizes short-term "queue hopping."
   - **Current Rate:** 1.00%

## MYT Performance Fee

Each Mix-Yield Token (MYT) vault skims a share of the gross yield generated by its underlying strategies before crediting the remainder to the MYT price. This fee funds strategy maintenance and ongoing protocol development.

- **Current Rate:** 15.00% (pending final DAO verification)
