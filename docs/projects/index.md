<img src={integrations} alt="Why Integrate Alchemix?" fetchpriority="high" class="banner-spacing" />

Alchemix V3 turns a single deposit of ETH or USDC into two complementary positions. First, the funds are wrapped into a Mix-Yield Token (MYT) that earns yield across a diversified set of strategies curated by the Alchemix DAO. That same collateral unlocks a credit line, allowing users to mint synthetic alAssets, alETH or alUSD, worth up to ninety percent of the deposit.

The redesigned Transmuted accepts these alAssets and, on a fixed schedule, returns MYT one-for-one. This mechanism keeps alAssets close to price parity with their underlying assets and created predictable, bond-like yield opportunities for anyone who accumulated alAssets below face value.

## Where the Platform Fits

- **DAO Treasuries** – Raise operating capital without liquidating long-term holdings. DAO’s can mint alAssets, exchange them for their required spending currency, and let the vault yield repay their debt over time.

- **Yield Strategists** – Loop assets for higher leverage. These users can recycle borrowed alAssets back into their vault positions, compounding exposure as high as practical leverage allows, all without facing variable interest rates.

- **Liquidity Providers** – LPs can pair alAssets with another token that tracks the same price (for example, alETH with frxETH) and eliminate impermanent-loss risk as both sides of the pool move in tandem.

## Core Features

| Feature                    | Purpose                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemist Vault (ERC-4626) | Aggregated yield for each base asset on every supported chain                                       |
| Mix-Yield Token (MYT)      | Tokenised basket of yield strategies, which can be unwrapped for the underlying assets at any time  |
| Transmuter                 | Fixed-duration redemptions that stabilise alAsset prices and create predictable return opportunties |
| Self-repaying CDP          | Debt is automatically retired by vault yield and scheduled redemptions                              |

## Why Integrate

Integrators gain a capital efficient way to unlock liquidity, a single-token gateway to competitive ETH and USD yields, and access to a growing synthetic-asset economy. Projects that integrate MYT or accept alAssets as collateral benefit from higher total value locked, simplified liquidity-pool management thanks to the absence of impermanent loss on like-for-like pairs, and joint marketing across the Alchemix ecosystem.

## Who Benefits Most

End users seeking passive yield, money-market protocols in search of high-quality collateral, vault curators adding new strategies, DAO treasuries managing runway, leverage-oriented yield farmers, and liquidity providers who want prices on both sides of a pool to move together.
