# Co-Marketing & BD Support

Alchemix V3 is built on a foundation of positive-sum collaboration. When you integrate with the Alchemix stack you become a strategic partner in a growing synthetic-asset economy. We provide the technical and social infrastructure to ensure your integration reaches the right audience and scales effectively.

### Partnership Onboarding & Enablement

We treat onboarding as a high-touch process to ensure technical success and strategic alignment from day one.

- **Direct Technical Conduit:** Partners gain a direct line of communication to Alchemix core contributors for implementation support, troubleshooting, and custom strategy alignment.
- **Strategic Launch:** Each partner is paired with a BD lead to coordinate launch strategy, ensuring the integration is timed for maximum ecosystem impact.
- **The Network:** We provide warm introductions to other Alchemix-aligned protocols, DAOs, and yield providers to help you build deeper integrations across the DeFi ecosystem.

### Co-Marketing & Ecosystem Amplification

The Alchemix DAO maintains one of the most engaged and technically-literate communities in DeFi. We leverage this social capital to drive meaningful eyes to your project.

- **Joint Narrative Building:** We collaborate through in-depth threads, blog posts, and newsletters that explain the _why_.
- **High-Impact Community Events:** Partners are invited to our weekly Fireside chats and co-hosted Twitter/X Spaces to present their value proposition directly to the Alchemix community.
- **Co-Branding Kit:** Access to high-resolution V3 assets and marketing templates to ensure a professional, cohesive look.

### Growth & Incentives

We believe in rewarding the liquidity and activity that drives the protocol forward.

- **Incentive Collaboration:** Where there is strategic overlap, the Alchemix DAO can collaborate on co-incentive programs or liquidity mining campaigns to bootstrap initial adoption.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Our BD and product teams stay in sync with our partners, ensuring the Alchemix V3 roadmap continues to support long-term needs.
- **Ecosystem Case Studies:** We highlight successful integrations through dedicated case studies and "Partner Spotlight" features, documenting the real-world value created by the collaboration.
