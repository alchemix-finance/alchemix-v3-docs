Alchemix V3 is published under a Business Source License (BUSL) 1.1. While the codebase is source-available, any commercial or production-use deployment requires a formal license agreement with the Alchemix Association.

The **Friendly Fork Initiative** provides a structured pathway for teams to deploy Alchemix V3 in ecosystems not currently served by the core protocol. This framework allows partners to build sovereign, localized versions of the Alchemix engine while maintaining a strategic and economic link to the Alchemix DAO.

## Partner Benefits

- **Commercial Production License:** Approved teams receive a worldwide, perpetual license to copy, modify, and deploy the Alchemix V3 codebase for their specific project.
- **Chain Exclusivity:** The Alchemix Association grants the licensee the **exclusive right** to deploy Alchemix V3 on their target blockchain for their approved assets, protecting the partner from dilutive "copycat" forks on the same network.
- **Direct Technical Advisory:** Access to the Alchemix core team for architecture review and implementation guidance.
- **Ecosystem Distribution:** Marketing support via Alchemix social channels and inclusion in the broader Alchemix ecosystem narrative.

## Programme Requirements & Rules

To maintain the integrity of the protocol and the interests of the Alchemix DAO, all friendly forks must adhere to the following:

### 1. Remuneration & Alignment

Friendly forks are designed as a "win-win" economic partnership. Licensees agree to:

- **License Fee:** A percentage allocation of the fork's native Project Token (if issued) to the Alchemix DAO, including dilution protection.
- **Revenue Share:** A tiered percentage of the monthly Gross Protocol Revenue (GPR) generated by the fork, paid to the Alchemix DAO.

### 2. Branding & Attribution

While the technology is Alchemix, the brand must be sovereign to avoid user confusion:

- **No Trademark Use:** Licensees **cannot** use Alchemix trademarks, including the names _Alchemix_, _alUSD_, _alETH_, _Transmuter_, or _Meta-Yield Token_. The fork must develop its own unique brand and asset names.
- **Required Attribution:** Documentation must clearly state the project is a "Licensed fork of Alchemix V3" and display the Alchemix Approved Logo in the user interface footer.

### 3. Security & Performance

- **Audit Mandate:** Any modifications to the core Alchemix V3 code must undergo an independent security audit. The Alchemix core team reserves a review period to evaluate the audit report before deployment.
- **KPI Metrics:** The Alchemix Association evaluates the project based on agreed-upon KPIs (such as TVL and Market Cap) after an initial performance evaluation period.
