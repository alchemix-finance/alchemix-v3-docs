<!-- TODO -->

Alchemix V3 is published under a Business Source License (BUSL). While the codebase is source-available, any commercial deployment requires approval and licensing from the Alchemix Association.

The Friendly Fork Initiative is designed for teams catering to ecosystems not currently served by Alchemix V3, or those offering a significantly differentiated and novel implementation of the protocol. Approved teams can apply for a commercial BUSL waiver to officially fork and maintain their own instance of Alchemix V3.

This framework enables teams to build custom Alchemix ecosystems, complete with custom yield strategies and Alchemists, that are purpose-built for their specific network and community.

## What teams receive from the initiative:

- **Commercial BUSL License:** A 3-year commercial license enabling the team to operate and monetize their deployment. Note: Code cannot be deployed on any chain where Alchemix V3 is already live.
- **Core Team Support:** Direct technical guidance and advisory from the Alchemix core developers.
- **Ecosystem Visibility:** Marketing support and cross-promotion through Alchemix social channels and community hubs.
- **Creative Autonomy:** The freedom to architect a custom version of V3, including unique collateral assets, yield strategies, and liquidity incentives.

## Programme Rules:

- **Association Approval:** Each friendly fork needs to go through the Alchemix Association and obtain a specific BUSL license.
- **Security Standards:** Each friendly fork is required to audit any changes made to the Alchemix V3 codebase in their specific deployment.
- **Sovereign Management:** Each friendly fork mints their own synthetic assets and is responsible for their own liquidity management.
