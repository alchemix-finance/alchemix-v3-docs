The more liquidity driving assets are owned, the more Alchemix can sustainably incentivize the primary alAsset liquidity pools. Alchemix also typically bribes voters to vote for emissions to these pools - where typically every $1 input results in greater than $1 emitted to the liquidity pool. Given the Elixir tends to own a significant share of the liquidity pools, this can result in a significant amount of value returned to the DAO in the form of CRV, CVX, and other assets.
